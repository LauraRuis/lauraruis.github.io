<p>This blog post is going to be about the above image, taken from 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.09485.pdf" target="_blank">Balestriero, Pesenti, and LeCun, 2021.</a> The goal is to reproduce it, and in the process of doing
that getting a better understanding of what this whole interpolation/extrapolation debate 
(<a href="https://twitter.com/ylecun/status/1409940043951742981" target="_blank">here</a> and
<a href="https://twitter.com/GaryMarcus/status/1411401507610796032" target="_blank">here</a> and
<a href="https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/1450524400227287040" target="_blank">here</a>) is about. I mean, I have to be honest,
after this post this whole debate is not going to be any clearer. David Hume can describe quite nicely what is probably 
going on in this discussion in his <em>‚Äúan enquiry concerning human understanding‚Äù</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It might reasonably be expected, in questions, which have been canvassed and disputed with great eagerness, since the 
first origin of science and philosophy, that the meaning of all terms, at least, should have been agreed upon among the
disputants; and our enquiries, in the course of two thousand years, have been able to pass from words to the true and 
real subject of the controversy. For how easy may it seem to give exact definitions of the terms employed in reasoning,
and make these definitions, not the mere sounds of words, the object of future scrutiny and examination? But if we consider
the matter more narrowly, we shall be apt to draw a quite opposite conclusion. From this circumstance alone, that a 
controversy has been long kept on foot, and remains still undecided, we may presume, that there is some ambiguity in
the expression, and that the disputants affix different ideas to the terms employed in the controversy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically; people seem to argue a lot about things that they haven‚Äôt defined properly (and the
last author on this paper <a href="https://twitter.com/ylecun/status/1450809828268548101" target="_blank">probably agrees</a>). 
Didn‚Äôt this quote make you think that I‚Äôm really smart just now?! Well think again, I didn‚Äôt read the book, the 
reason I‚Äôm writing this blogpost is because I didn‚Äôt understand the learning in high dimensions
paper at all on first reading, and wanted to get a better understanding.</p>

<p>After this post, we will hopefully know more about the following terms:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The curse of dimensionality (section ..)</li>
  <li>Convex hull (section ..)</li>
  <li>Ambient dimension (section ..)</li>
  <li>Intrinsic dimension / Data manifold dimension (section ..)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-key-idea"><span style="color:#C0392B">The Key Idea</span></h2>
<p>The key idea in this paper is that we shouldn‚Äôt be using interpolation and extrapolation as indicators
of generalization performance, because models are almost surely extrapolating. It doesn‚Äôt matter what the intrinsic dimension
of the data manifold is, which may be much lower than the dimensionality of our data representation. The authors hope that
the paper opens the door to better suited geometrical definitions of interpolation and extrapolation that align
with generalization performances in the context of high dimensional data. So let‚Äôs dive in!</p>

<p>The definition of interpolating in the paper is the following:</p>
